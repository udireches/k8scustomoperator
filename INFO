NOTE ereches namespace must exist already (for example created thru feature_branch_creation
OTHERWISE, if no namespace, change the name space in PodSetOperatorMain from ereches to default and run all the below WITHOUT ereches


Build  -  mvn clean install
Create the CRD in ereches NS - kubectl -n ereches apply -f src/main/resources/crd.yaml
See podset is created (but no podsets yet) - kubectl -n ereches get podset
Run the operator  - mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.fabric8.podset.operator.PodSetOperatorMain
Create a resource instance (the operator will create the pods) - kubectl -n ereches apply -f src/main/resources/cr.yaml
see the pods in k8s or "kubectl get pods"
See the podest instance - kubectl -n ereches get podset
Delete all podset instances (but not the podset definition) kubectl -n ereches delete podsets --all
Delete the crd definition  - kubectl  -n ereches delete crd podsets.demo.fabric8.io
